# California Water Data Challenge material

This repository contains material for my participation in the [California Water Data Challenge](http://waterchallenge.data.ca.gov/), both from the hackathon at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS) on Sep 14-15, and from later work before the final submission on Oct 1.

Testing if changes to the source repo are shown in the organization repo.
